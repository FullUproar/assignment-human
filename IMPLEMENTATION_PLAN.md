- [ ] Natural language mission creation

## Technical Decisions

### Stack Confirmation
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Hosting**: Vercel (frontend), Railway (backend + DB)
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js (optional accounts)
- **State**: Zustand
- **Animations**: Framer Motion + CSS

### Key Priorities
1. **Speed**: Zero to assignment in <30 seconds
2. **Safety**: All missions public, no financial transactions
3. **Scale**: Support 10,000+ concurrent users
4. **Impact**: Measurable real-world outcomes

### Development Principles
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Progressive enhancement
- Privacy by default
- Open source friendly
- Community-driven content

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Set up Next.js project** with TypeScript
2. **Create database schema** and migrate data
3. **Build API endpoints** for core functionality
4. **Deploy MVP** to production environment
5. **Begin user testing** with 100 beta users

## Success Metrics

- Time to first assignment: <30 seconds ✓
- Assignment acceptance rate: >70%
- Completion rate: >60%
- User return rate: >40%
- Geographic spread: 50+ cities by month 6

## Resources Needed

- Domain: assignmenthuman.com (already owned)
- Hosting: ~$20-50/month initially
- Database: ~$25/month for managed PostgreSQL
- CDN: Included with Vercel
- Monitoring: Free tiers initially

## Risk Mitigation

- **Content moderation**: Community reporting + review queue
- **Scaling issues**: CDN + caching + database optimization
- **User safety**: Public spaces only, no personal info required
- **Legal concerns**: Clear terms of service, no liability for missions

This roadmap provides a clear path from the current prototype to a production-ready platform that can scale to serve millions of agents worldwide.
