## Implementation Priority

When updating the platform:
1. Assignment = individual task (most important to be consistent)
2. Mission = collection of assignments
3. Agent = user terminology
4. Objective = the goal of each assignment
5. Classification = category system

This nomenclature creates a coherent universe where users feel like agents in a meaningful organization, working on assignments that ladder up to missions, which contribute to humanity's operations for positive change.
